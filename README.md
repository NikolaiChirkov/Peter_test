### Comment from repo author

Idk why, but HR gave me only Android model to create website layout. OK, I've done that.

Check only with screen width equals to 360px. In other cases, I don't take responsibility for your melting eyes. 

Also, after starting server change "jsx" option to "react" in tsconfig, or tsc will curse you. 

### Update comment 22/02/2021

I can't believe in that.

The story: I wanted to refactor & improve peter-test project. When I start to work I mentioned one thing: the data from peter partner's link isn't parse. "Okay, that may be code mistake" - I thought. But no: someone just fucked up SSL sertificate on peter partner's site. And all protection protocols started to break connection with 'unprotected' site. Real foobar situation.

I glad I hadn't pass through interview in that company.
